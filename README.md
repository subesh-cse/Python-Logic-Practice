## üìÇ Folder Structure

| Folder    | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Basics    | Number-based logic problems (prime numbers, factorials, sum of digits, leap year checks, etc.) |
| Strings   | String manipulation problems (palindrome checks, reversing, counting vowels, removing duplicates) |
| Patterns  | Pattern printing using loops (stars, numbers, pyramids, diamonds) |
| Arrays    | Array-based problems (sum, max/min, two-pointer problems, comparisons) |
| Loops     | Problems primarily solved using loops and iteration logic |
| Functions | Recursion and function-based problems |
| Mixed     | Problems combining multiple concepts (arrays + strings, loops + recursion, etc.) |
